# Personal Branding Page

This is a simple personal branding page that you can deploy to GitHub Pages.

## How to Deploy to GitHub Pages

1.  **Create a new repository on GitHub:**
    *   Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in to your account.
    *   Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository".
    *   Name your repository. For a user/organization page, name it `<your-username>.github.io`. For a project page, you can name it anything (e.g., `my-branding-page`).
    *   You can add a description (optional).
    *   Choose "Public" visibility.
    *   You can initialize it with a README if you haven't created one locally (though this set of instructions assumes you are pushing an existing project).
    *   Click "Create repository".

2.  **Push your files to the repository:**
    *   If you created the files locally (like this `index.html`, `style.css`, and `README.md`), open your terminal or command prompt.
    *   Navigate to the directory where your files are located.
    *   Initialize a git repository if you haven't already:
        ```bash
        git init
        git add .
        git commit -m "Initial commit: Add personal branding page files"
        ```
    *   Add the remote repository URL (you can find this on your GitHub repository page under "Code"):
        ```bash
        git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repository-name>.git
        ```
    *   Push your files to the main branch (or master, depending on your default):
        ```bash
        git push -u origin main
        ```

3.  **Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings:**
    *   Go to your repository on GitHub.
    *   Click on the "Settings" tab.
    *   In the left sidebar, scroll down to the "Code and automation" section and click on "Pages".
    *   Under "Build and deployment":
        *   For "Source", select "Deploy from a branch".
        *   For "Branch", select `main` (or `master`) and `/ (root)` folder, then click "Save".
    *   GitHub Pages will build and deploy your site. It might take a few minutes.
    *   Once deployed, you will see a URL where your site is live (e.g., `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/` if it's a project page, or `https://<your-username>.github.io/` if it's a user/organization page).

## Customizing Your Page

1.  **Edit `index.html`:**
    *   Replace `[Your Name/Brand]` in the `<header>` and `<footer>` with your actual name or brand.
    *   Update the "About Me" section with your personal information.
    *   Modify the "Projects" section:
        *   Change "Project Title 1", "Project Title 2", etc., to your actual project titles.
        *   Replace the placeholder descriptions with details about your projects.
        *   Change the `src` attribute of the `<img>` tags from `https://via.placeholder.com/...` to your actual project images (you can upload images to your repository and link them, e.g., `images/project1.png`).
    *   Update the "Contact" section with your email and links to your social media profiles.
2.  **Edit `style.css`:**
    *   Feel free to modify the CSS to change the look and feel of your page (colors, fonts, layout, etc.).

That's it! You now have a personal branding page deployed on GitHub Pages.
